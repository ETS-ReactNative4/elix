These packages define the web components in the Elix project
and the lower-level pieces they depend upon.

Each package in this folder is registered separately with npm, where the folder
name matches the package name. E.g., the contents of the elix-autosize-textarea
folder are registered as a package called elix-autosize-textarea.

See the project's top-level [README](../) for information on installing and
using these packages. See the individual packages for details on the components
they define.
