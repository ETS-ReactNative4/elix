      The dialog below is sitting inside a container that has a CSS transform
      applied to it, which forces the creation of a stacking context. As a
      result, the dialog does not appear over other page elements as expected.
      The text of this paragraph, for example, is selectable even when the
      dialog is open, and buttons on the page can still be clicked. The dialog
      is also positioned with respect to the stacking context's boundaries,
      rather than with respect to the page as desired. Finally, the dialog's
      semi-transparent backdrop cannot be seen.
