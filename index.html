    The Elix project seeks to provide a comprehensive set of
    solid, well-designed web components that implement very common user
    interface patterns. Each component can be used as is, or as the foundation
    for new components.
  </p>
  <p>
    See the main
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix">Elix</a>
    repository for details.

  <h3>Demos</h3>
  <p>
    For now, this placeholder site just hosts demos of the project's top-level
    components.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <!-- Component demo links go here -->
  </ul>
  <p>
    The project also includes an extensive series of
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix/tree/master/packages/elix-component-mixins">web component mixins</a> and
    auxiliary components you can use to create your own custom elements.
