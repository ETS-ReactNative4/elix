    The Elix project seeks to provide a comprehensive set of
    solid, well-designed web components that implement very common user
    interface patterns. Each component can be used as is, or as the foundation
    for new components.

    See the main
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix">Elix</a>
    repository for details.

  <h3>Demos</h3>
  <p>
    For now, this placeholder site just hosts demos of the project's top-level
    components.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/singleSelection.html">Single-selection</a>.
        Shows the use of <code>SingleSelectionMixin</code> in an extremely
        simple component.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/listBox.html">List box</a>.
        Shows how several mixins cooperate to enable a very basic
        single-selection list box.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/horizontalList.html">Horizontal list</a>.
        A list box with a horizontal orientation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/browserPluginList.html">Browser plugin list</a>.
        A list box with a hard-coded set of list items.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/labeledTabs.html">Labeled tabs</a>.
        A set of panels with classic rounded tabs.
        <p class="note">
          (Works in Chrome and macOS Safari, but a polyfill bug prevents this
          from working in mobile Safari, Firefox, Edge, and IE. Additionally,
          macOS Safari has a layout bug that causes tabs to initially render
          incorrectly when their position is changed at runtime.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="demos/toolbarTabs.html">Toolbar tabs</a>.
        Tabs used as the overall navigation UI model for a mobile app.
        <p class="note">
          (Works in Chrome; bugs in Safari and the polyfill prevent user
          interactions from changing the selected toolbar button.)
        </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The project also includes an extensive series of
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix/tree/master/mixins">web component mixins</a> and
    auxiliary components you can use to create your own custom elements.
