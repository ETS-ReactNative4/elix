/*
 * The complete set of Elix elements and mixins.
 * 
 * This file is the primary entry point to the Elix package, so its exports are
 * what is obtained if you write `import * from "elix"`. However, in
 * production use it will be much more efficient to directly load just the
 * components you need from the /src folder. This file is also used during
 * testing, as it causes all Elix's elements to be loaded.
 * 
 * NOTE: Do not edit this file by hand. This file is generated during
 * publishing, or you can regenerate it with `npm run prepublishOnly`.
