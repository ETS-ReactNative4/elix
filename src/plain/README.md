This folder contains the Plain reference design systembuilt on the Elix base components.

As their name implies, the base components are intended to be used as the base for a design system. The base components are not designed to be directly instantiable.

These Plain components, in contrast, _are_ designed to be ready for immediate use on pages. They add a minimal degree of styling on top of the base components so that the components are usable. The "Plain" name is meant to convey a core principle of this design system: it's meant to be as plain as possible so that it can fit in with a variety of application styles. One way of thinking about it: The Plain components try to imagine what the next 100 HTML elements might look like.
