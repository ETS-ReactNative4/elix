# Elix mixins

This project implements common web component features as JavaScript mixins. This
allows you to create your own web components in plain
JavaScript, while avoiding much of the boilerplate that comes up in component
creation. The mixins permit flexibility and a pay-as-you-go approach to
complexity and performance.

All of the top-level [Elix elements](https://elix.org/documentation/elements)
are constructed with these mixins. In fact, by design, most of those components
are little more than combinations of mixins.

See the [mixin documentation](https://elix.org/documentation/mixins) for more
details on this approach, and full documentation for each mixin.
